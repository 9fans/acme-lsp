# acme-lsp

[Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org/) tools for [acme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)).

Documentation: https://godoc.org/github.com/fhs/acme-lsp/cmd/L

## Status

**This project is currently very experimental.**
However, basic commands seem to be working with [go-langserver](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-langserver) and [pyls](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server). Other language servers need to be tested.
